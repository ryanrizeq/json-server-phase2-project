# CocktaiList JSON Server

## CocktaiList

This backend repository goes along with the repository located at https://github.com/ryanrizeq/phase-2-project

Ensure you follow the below steps to get all setup. 

## Setup

Fork and clone this repo. Then install the dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

## Seeding Data

Any time you want to reset your database back to your original data, run
`npm run seed` again. Doing this will overwrite all the data in your `db.json`
file, so make sure you don't have any data in that file that you don't mind
losing!

## Running the Server Locally

To run your server in development mode, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

While running in development mode, the server will re-load any time you make
changes to the `db.json` file, so you can test our your seed data.

While your server is running, you can make requests to
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Check it out in the browser to
make sure your server works!
